# CriminalIntent

  This is an application built for learning purposes based on text book called Big Nerd Ranch. I have completed all the programming challenges which are present at the end of each chapters.
  It basically helps to report office crimes and it contains the following features:
  
  * Report a crime.
  * Master detail interface between displaying a list of crimes and detail crime info activity.
  * Use camera to click images
  * Pick suspects from contacts list 
  * Either call or message the suspected crime doer
  
  In this application I made use of Recycler view to display a list of crimes, View pager to swipe between crimes, Content providers to pick contacts, Implicit intents to click photos, SQL lite to store user data, Custom dialogs to select date and time.
